            <li>3-4 large tortillas</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Trim any fat off the chicken and pat the chicken dry. Then season it with salt and
                let it permeate for 5 minutes.
            <li>
                While the chicken is sitting, chop up the head of lettuce in thin inch long strips
            </li>
            <li>
                Pat the chicken dry again and trim any fat off. Then add the adobo seasoning
            </li>
            <li>
                Put a large pan on medium-high heat and put in your olive oil and coat the pan
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the pan is hot enough, place chicken thighs in pan with some space in between.
                Let cook on one side for 4 minutes, then flip and let cook for an additional 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place chicken aside on a plate, then drain your beans and add to a small pot with any 
                seasonings you may want. Add your cup of water and bring it to a boil, once boiling
                bring down to a simmer and let simmer for 5-6 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                After beans are done, drain and let cool. While cooling, you can heat up your tortillas
                in the pan used for the chicken on medium heat. Remove once tortillas are warm.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally, you can put all your ingredients together on the tortilla and wrap your burritos!
