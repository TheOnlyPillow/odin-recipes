        <ol>

                with some paper towels.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slices your potatoes length wise about half an inch thick. Then slice those chunks
                so that you have strips of potatoes about half an inch thick
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix all your seasonings together in a small bowl until well blended
            </li>
            <li>
                Toss your sliced potatoes on a pan or bowl, then add your olive oil and make sure
                all the potatoes have some oil on them. Then toss them with your seasoning
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat your air fryer to 375F and make sure to coat the base with some cooking spray
            </li>
            <li>
                Once preheated, add your potatoes and let cook for 8 minutes, then toss the potatoes and 
                then let cook for an additional 7-8 minutes. Add more time if wanting a more burnt / 
                crispy texture
            </li>
            <li>
                Take them out and let them cool for 1 minute before serving, and you're done!
