        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Using a large pot, pour your water in and set it on high to boil. Place a second small pot, pour
                your sauce in, and turn the burner on low. Make sure to stir the sauce occasionally.
            <li>
                Once the water is boiling, add your salt and give it a stir, then add your pasta and stir it into the pot
                as it softens. Stir occasionally for about 9 minutes for al dente, 11 minutes for fully cooked.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the sauce is still on low, slowly stir in the romano cheese with the sauce. Once all your
                cheese has combined with the sauce you can turn the heat off and leave the pot on the stove.
            </li>
            <li>
                At this point your pasta should be close to being ready. Once it is at your preferred doneness, 
                drain the pot leaving about 1/4 cup of pasta water with the pasta.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix the pasta and the sauce together and stir until all the fettucine is covered. Then put your
                parmesean on top and mix if you like and serve!
